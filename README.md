# üìÑ PDF Chatbot with LLMs

This project implements a **PDF Chatbot** that allows users to query PDF documents intelligently using large language models (LLMs) and vector search. The code explores different LLMs and techniques for document understanding and retrieval.

---
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status
This project is experimental and under active development.
The code is intended for learning & experimentation. Features may change, and improvements are ongoing.
Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## üöÄ Features

* Upload and query PDF files.
* Leverages vector embeddings for document chunk search.
* Supports multiple LLM backends for answering questions:

  * **LLaMA 2**
  * **GPT-4**
  * **Google T5**
  * **OpenAI GPT**
* Embedding generation using:

  * **Sentence Transformers**
  * **Hugging Face Transformers**
* Vector database:

  * **Pinecone** for fast similarity search
* Framework:

  * **LangChain** for orchestration of LLMs, embeddings, and tools

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ PDF is uploaded and split into chunks.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Chunks are embedded into vector representations.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Vector store (Pinecone) indexes the embeddings.
4Ô∏è‚É£ On user query:

* Relevant chunks are retrieved by similarity search.
* Selected LLM generates an answer based on the retrieved content.

---

## üìå Observations

* **Google T5** consistently provided the most accurate and context-aware responses.
* **LLaMA 2** worked well but showed variations depending on prompt and chunking.

## ‚úÖ Setup

```bash
pip install langchain sentence-transformers pinecone-client openai transformers
```

Set your API keys:

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"] = "..."
```

## üí° Future Work

* Add GUI / web interface for PDF upload & chat.
* Explore additional LLMs (e.g., Mistral, Claude).
* Optimize chunking and embedding strategies for longer documents.
